parts
1- intro to lsa idea
document summarization
"important sentences and words"
themes of document expressed in theme words
discuss document/term and sentence/term ideas
to find most important documents, most important terms
tag clouds.

key idea - most important sentence has many theme words
second most important does not share words.
sentence/word matrix
svd on matrix
analsyses sentences and words in relation, not just in isolation
sorts sentences by "independence" with "most theme words"
sorts theme words by "centrality"

2- reuters corpus
this is unsupervised learning, need test data with external standard for what are summaries
do not have this corpus.
instead, newspaper articles are structured in a pre-summarized manner. The "lede", the most important sentence, should be the theme of the article. The second sentence should 'reinforce' or 'elaborate' on the information in the first sentence. This test uses the Reuters corpus as "pre-tagged" test data, since the articles should be structured in theme/elaboration structure.

how does being short matter? short sentences are probably a help. # of sentences does help with accuracy.

examples of sentences that work and sentences that dont
need knime vis of correlation across algorithms

3 - first results
Expected use in search engines
document summarization
examine only success with sentences
explain scoring.
algorithms & pos in "appendix"
quick expl: algorithms sweep over values in sentence-term matrix and 

overall results:
first = first, second = second,
consistently 15%-25% CHECK
  justifies orthogonal vector concept
first or second in top 2 - consistent -
  justifies "theme concept" 
meaning that LSA concept is good.
POS consistently 15% better CHECK
Binary gives best 0
Normal gives best overall and much better at 1 (approximate score)
Counts not so much - repeating theme words does not help
