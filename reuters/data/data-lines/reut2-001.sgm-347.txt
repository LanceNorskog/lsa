U.S. TREASURY OFFICIAL SEES LATIN DEBT PROGRESS

Assistant U.S. Treasury Secretary David Mulford said rapid progress was being made in talks with commercial banks for loans to Argentina, the Philippines and Brazil.
 "This should result in substantial new lending for the major debtors in 1987," he said in prepared testimony for the Subcommittee on International Development Institutions of the U.S. House of Representatives.
 Until recently, commercial banks were slow to conclude new financing packages pending completion of a Mexican package, Mulford said.  Reuter &#3;
