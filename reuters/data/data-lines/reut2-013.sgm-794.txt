SPAIN TO SELL BARLEY TO SAUDI ARABIA

Spain will shortly sign with Saudi Arabia an order for barley for April/May delivery, trade sources said.
 They gave no details on amounts or prices, but said it would be a "major" order.
 Saudi Arabia bought 500,000 tonnes of Spanish barley last year.  Reuter &#3;
