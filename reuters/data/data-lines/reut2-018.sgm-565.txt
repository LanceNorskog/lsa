CSR DECLARES PIONEER SUGAR BID UNCONDITIONAL

CSR Ltd <CSRA.S> said it had declared unconditional its takeover bid for <Pioneer Sugar Mills Ltd> following Pioneer's recommendation that shareholders accept.
 This meant Pioneer shareholders would be paid for all shares tendered within 14 days, CSR said in a statement.
 CSR's statement follows Industrial Equity Ltd's <INEA.S> disclosure yesterday that it had built up a 9.8 pct stake in Pioneer at 2.54 dlrs a share, topping CSR's cash bid of 2.50.
 CSR is also offering one share, currently worth 4.04 dlrs, plus 1.20 cash, for every two Pioneer shares, which values Pioneer at 2.62 per share. It holds about 33 pct of Pioneer.  REUTER &#3;
