TAIWAN BUYS 32,000 TONNES OF U.S. SOYBEANS

The joint committee of Taiwan's soybean importers awarded a contract to Cargill Inc of Minneapolis, Minnesota, for supply of one 32,000 tonne cargo of U.S. Soybeans, a committee spokesman told Reuters.
 The cargo, priced at 249.10 U.S. Dlrs per tonne c and f Taiwan, is set for delivery before July 7, he said.
 The committee cancelled a tender for another cargo because the prices offered by U.S. Suppliers were too high, he added.  REUTER &#3;
