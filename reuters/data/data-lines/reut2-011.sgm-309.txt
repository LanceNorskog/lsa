ALLIED-SIGNAL <ALD> TO SHARE METALS TECHNOLOGY

Allied-Signal Inc's Metglas Products said it and <Vacuumschmelze GmbH> signed a licensing agreement whereby each may practice the other's technology for amorphous metals in magnetic applications.
 Amorphous metal products are used in such devices as switch-mode power supplies and other electronic components. They are based on a proprietary rapid solidification process that gives metals a glasslike molecular structure, making them stronger, more ductile and corrosion-resistant, with unusual magnetic charateristics.
