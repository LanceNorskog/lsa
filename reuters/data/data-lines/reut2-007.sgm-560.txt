FINLAND CONSIDERS ABOLISHING PRICE CONTROLS

An official proposal that Finland scrap price controls and replace them with a system aimed at promoting competition is expected to go to parliament later this year, officials said.
 The proposal handed to the government yesterday calls for parliament to be empowered to order three-month price freezes in place of the controls.
 It proposes that a new board be set up to ensure large firms do not abuse their market positions and that monopolies do not expand beyond their approved sectors.  REUTER &#3;
