U.S. PRODUCTIVITY REPORT RESCHEDULED TO MAY 4

The Labor Department said it rescheduled the release of the first-quarter nonfarm productivity report to May 4 at 1000 EDT (1400 GMT) from April 27.
 The delay was necessary because the Commerce Department moved back release of national income and product data used by the Labor Department to compute productivity.  Reuter &#3;
