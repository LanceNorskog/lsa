USSR CORN BUYING MAY BE 3.5 MLN TONNES--AMSTUTZ

The Soviet Union's recent corn purchases from the United States could total as much as 3.5 mln tonnes, U.S. Agriculture Undersecretary Daniel Amstutz said.
 "We are not sure how much (Soviets have bought) but we think it could be as high as 3.5 mln tonnes," Amstutz told a House Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee.
 He added that China also will need to import more corn this year than earlier anticipated, but he gave no figures.  Reuter &#3;
