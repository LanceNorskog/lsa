EC LEADERS BEGIN BRUSSELS SUMMIT

Leaders of the European Community (EC) began their two-day summit, with reform of the group's creaking finances heading the agenda, officials said.
 The 12 government leaders were joined by French President Mitterrand and their foreign ministers.
 The twice-yearly meeting will also examine some world issues, especially the Middle East, but diplomats said the group's cash crisis would dominate the talks.  Reuter &#3;
