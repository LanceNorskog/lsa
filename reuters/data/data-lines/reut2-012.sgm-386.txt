GAF <GAF> DEBT MAY BE DOWNGRADED BY S/P

Standard and Poor's Corp said it may downgrade GAF Corp's 415 mln dlrs of BB-minus senior debt and B-rated subordinated debt.
 S and P cited GAF's 3.2 billion dlr acquisition offer for Borg-Warner Corp <BOR>. Pro forma, debt leverage would rise to nearly 90 pct, assuming total financing. But proceeds from asset sales would probably pay down debt, the agency noted.
 Borg-Warner's 420 mln dlr A-plus senior debt and A-1 commercial paper were placed on creditwatch December one. S and P said it will review the timing and extent of asset sales, debt reduction and strategic benefits of the purchase.  Reuter &#3;
