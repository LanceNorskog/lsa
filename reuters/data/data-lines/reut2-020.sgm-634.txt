AEG TO REORGANIZE ENERGY BUSINESS

Electrical engineering group AEG AG <AEGG.F>, in which Daimler-Benz AG <DAIG.F> has a majority, is reorganizing its energy business, AEG said in a statement.
 AEG will invest 250 mln marks over the next three years in a new turbines, electrical machinery and power station plant division, which will include its <AEG Kanis GmbH> subsidiary.
 The investment includes a new turbine factory for AEG Kanis in Essen, and the restructuring of AEG's Nuremberg works into a specialized components and rotor factory.
 The project is part of the Daimler group's energy technology strategy, AEG said.  Reuter &#3;
