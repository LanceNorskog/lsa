BRITISH TELECOM TO SELL EQUIPMENT IN NORTH AMERICA

British Telecommunications Plc <BTY.L> will market electronic data transmission equipment of its own design in North America, a spokesman said.
 The spokesman told Reuters the equipment, known as fourth-generation modems, will be sold by <Mitel Datacom Inc>, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Canada's Mitel Corp <MLT.TO>, in which British Telecom has a controlling stake.
 He declined to comment on the volume of projected sales. He said the modems, already available in Europe where they hold a majority share of the market, were the first of their kind to comply with the latest international standards.  Reuter &#3;
