CERMETEK <CRMK> INCREASES WORK WEEK

Cermetek Microelectronics Inc said it will return to a full 40 hour work week, efective at the end of this month, as a result of increased business.
 Last October Cermetek, a maker of modems, data base access and communications terminals, reduced its work week to 36 hours to reduce costs.  Reuter &#3;
