INTERNATIO-MUELLER ACQUIRES CANADIAN COMPANY

Internatio-Mueller NV <INTN.AS> said it will acquire <Promac Controls Inc> of Canada but declined to comment on the amount of the payment, which will be in cash.
 Promac, which produces measurement and regulating equipment, has a work force of 50 and had 1986 turnover of five mln guilders, an Internatio spokesman said.
 He said the takeover fits into the company's drive for expansion in the U.S and Canada and further acquisitions are possible.
 Promac Controls will be part of Internatio's electrotechnical sector.  REUTER &#3;
