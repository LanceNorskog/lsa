DELTA SAYS COURT ORDER WILL NOT DELAY MERGER

Delta Air Lines <DAL> said a court order requiring Western Air Lines <WAL> to arbitrate with two of its unions will not delay the April 1 merger between the two airlines.
 The order, which was issued by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, requires Western to discuss with its two unions whether Western's labor contracts will be binding for Delta, Delta said.
 "Nevertheless, the court order could cause significant personnel problems, including the possible delay of wage increases Delta had planned to give the Western personnel on April 1," Ronald Allen, Delta's president, said.
 Delta said it feels the court has erred and should reconsider the order.  Reuter &#3;
