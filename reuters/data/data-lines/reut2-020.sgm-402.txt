KCBT HALTS TRADING IN VALUE LINE STOCK FUTURES

The Kansas City Board of Trade said it has halted trading in Value Line stock index futures.
 The exchange said the move follows the halt in trading in futures, futures-options and options at several other exchanges because many of the underlying stocks that make up the indexes have stopped trading.
 The exchange said trading would resume pending action by the other exchanges.  Reuter &#3;
