HENKEL SELLS HAMBURG OIL AND FATS SUBSIDIARY

Applied chemicals group Henkel KGaA <HNKG.F> said it is selling its Hamburg vegetable oil and fats subsidiary Noblee und Thoerl GmbH to Oelmuehle Hamburg AG.
 A company spokesman declined to give the purchase price. Noblee, a supplier of specialised refined oils and fats to the food processing industry, had turnover of 161 mln marks last year.
 A Henkel statement said the divestment was part of the company's strategy of concentrating on its core businesses. For Oelmuehle, the acquisition of Noblee means access to new markets, the statement added.  REUTER &#3;
