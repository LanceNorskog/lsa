TREASURY'S BAKER OPPOSES STOCK TRANSACTION TAX

Treasury Secretary James Baker said he opposed a stock transactions tax proposed by House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Tex, or other special taxes.
 "The stock transfer tax would be a particularly unfortunate approach to take," Baker said in an interview with Cable News Network.
 The United States has some of the most efficient capital markets in the world and new taxes would impair efficiency, he said.  Reuter &#3;
