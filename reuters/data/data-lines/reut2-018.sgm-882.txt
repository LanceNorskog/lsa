BELGIUM PLANS MAJOR TELECOMMUNICATIONS ORDER

Belgium is to start negotiations with three consortia on sharing out a major order for modernising the country's telecommunications network, a government spokesman said.
 The three consortia are Bell Telephone Manufacturing Co NV, a subsidiary of ITT Corp <ITT>, together with Acec SA <ACEC.BR>; Siemens AG <SIEG.F> and ATEA SA, a subsidiary of GTE Corp <GTE>; and NV Philips Gloeilampenfabrieken <PGLO.AS> with American Telephone and Telegraph Co <T>.
  The deal is estimated to be worth around 50 billion francs, although a government spokeswoman declined to confirm this. The order covers new telephone exchanges, cables and terminals.
 The go-ahead for the talks followed an outline agreement within the centre-right government coalition today. The accord came after months of discussions that have been complicated by demands for the order to be shared out fairly between the French and Dutch speaking parts of Belgium.
 Government officials declined to give details of the outline agreement or how the order will be divided between the three consortia.   Reuter &#3;
