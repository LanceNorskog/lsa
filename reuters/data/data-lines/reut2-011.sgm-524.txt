IMMUNEX <IMNX> GETS FDA OKAY FOR HUMAN TESTS

Immunex Corp said it received Food and Drug Administration approval to begin human clinical testing of a protein as a possible treatment for cancer.
 The company said the protein, granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor, stimulates production of white blood cells essential to the body's immune function. It said it is developing the compound with <Behringwerke AG>, a subsidiary of Hoechst AG.
 Immunex said the drug's potential applications include restoration of white blood cell function, destruction of tumor cells, and as an AIDS treatment.  Reuter &#3;
