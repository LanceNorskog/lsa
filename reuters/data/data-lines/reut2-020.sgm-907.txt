U.S. BANKERS WARN OF EXTENDED STOCK MARKET DROP

U.S. bank executives said if the precipitous fall in the stock market continued it could force banks to demand more collateral on stock loans and hurt consumer borrowing.
 But the leaders of the American Bankers Association, which is holding its annual convention, said the drop was probably only temporary and the market would eventually recover because of the strength of the economy.
 "The underlying basics of the economy are still strong," Mark Olson, president of the ABA, the largest U.S. bankers group, said.  Reuter &#3;
