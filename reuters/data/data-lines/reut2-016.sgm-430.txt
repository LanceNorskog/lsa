SUNCOOK BANK MEETING ENJOINED BY COURT ORDER

BankEast Corp <BENH> said a state Superior Court enjoined <Suncook Bank> from delivering any notices of shareholder meetings until it produces a shareholder list.
 The order effectively prevents Suncook from holding any shareholder meetings until BankEast has a copy of its shareholder list, BankEast said.
 The order also gives BankEast, which is eyeing a takeover of the bank, 30 days to communicate with its shareholders of Suncook, it said.
 BankEast, which said it is a substantial stockholder in Suncook Bank, said the order came from the Merrimack County Superior Court.
 At the same time, it said the Bank of New Hampshire Corp's  <BNHC> Bank of New Hampshire also has made a bid for Suncook Bank.  Reuter &#3;
