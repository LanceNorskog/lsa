HOME SHOPPING SAYS IT NOT INVESTIGATION TARGET

Home Shopping Network Inc <HSN> said, in response to published reports, that it is not the target of a formal Securities and Exchange commission investigation.
 It said, instead, that the SEC initiated an informal inquiry of all parties involved in the Home Shopping/C.O.M.B. Co <CMCO> merger negotiations to determine the source of rumors that caused the stocks to rise prior to a public announcement in January.
 Home Shopping said it cooperated fully and had no indication that the informal inquiry is being pursued.  Reuter &#3;
