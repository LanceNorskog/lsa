OLSON <OLSN> TO HAVE LOSS FROM EGG UNIT SALE

Olson Industries Inc said it is in final negotiations on the sale of its remaining egg operations and expects the sale to generate a charge of about two mln dlrs against 1987 net income.
 The company said, however, that the sale will generate substantial cash flow to pay off bank debt and improve working capital, eliminate unmanageable effects on profits of the price instability of the egg business and allow it to concentrate on its plastics packaging business.  Reuter &#3;
