LAWSON SAYS LOUVRE CURRENCY ACCORD SATISFACTORY

The Louvre agreement by the Group of Seven finance ministers and central bankers to stabilise currencies has worked well and needs no fundamental strengthening at the economic summit in Venice on June 8-10, U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson said.
 Previewing the summit, which he expected would not produce any major new economic initiatives, Lawson told reporters work remained to be done on improving the conditions for lasting world economic growth.
