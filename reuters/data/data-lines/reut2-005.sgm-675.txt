DATAPOWER <DPWRC> FELL BELOW NASD REQUIREMENTS

Datapower Inc said it failed to meet the NASDAQ capital and surplus requirements as of February 20, but it received an exemption which will allow its common stock to continue to be included in the automated quotation system, subject to certain conditions.
 Should Nasdaq terminate quotation of its securities at some future date, the securities will continue to be quoted in the over-the-counter market, Datapower also said.  Reuter &#3;
