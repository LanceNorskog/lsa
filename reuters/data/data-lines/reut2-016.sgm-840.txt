TEXAS AIR'S <TEX> UNIT TO CUT STAFF

Texas Air Corp's Eastern Airlines subsidiary said it will cut 259 jobs for mechanics and related employees in Miami and Boston, effective around May One.
 The company said part of the staff cuts result from the proposed sale of five Boeing Co <BA> 727-100's and two Lockheed Corp <LK> L-1011's, as well as the previously announced transfer of six <Airbus Industrie> A300's to Continental Airlines, another Texas Air subsidiary.  Reuter &#3;
