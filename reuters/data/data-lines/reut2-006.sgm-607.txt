WELLCOME FALLS ON BRISTOL-MYERS AIDS DRUG REPORT

Shares of Wellcome Plc <WELL.L> fell sharply following a report that Bristol-Myers Co <BMY> would seek U.S. Food and Drug Administration permission to test its aids vaccine in humans by the end of March, dealers said.
 Wellcome shares slumped to a quoted low of 453p on the report after yesterday's 496p close but later rose to 464p.
 Earlier this month a Wellcome spokesman said the company was applying for licences in the U.S. And several major countries for its "Retrovir" drug which can be used for the treatment of Aids. The U.K. Department of Health and Social Security has already issued a marketing licence for "Retrovir."  Reuter &#3;
