 The other participants are Western Mining Corp Holdings Ltd <WMNG.S> (WMC) and Poseidon Ltd <POSA.S>, GMK said in a brief statement. It gave no further details.
 KMA is owned 52 pct by <Kalgoorlie Lake Pty Ltd> (KLV) and 48 pct by a local unit of Homestake Mining Co <HM>.
 KLV in turn is owned 47 pct each by Poseidon and GMK and six pct by WMC.
