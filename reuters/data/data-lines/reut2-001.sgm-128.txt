ITALIAN PRIME MINISTER CRAXI SAYS HE WILL RESIGN

Socialist Prime Minister Bettino Craxi said his five party coalition government would resign.
 Craxi, Italy's prime minister for a postwar record of 3-1/2 years, told the Senate (upper house) he would hand his and the government's resignation to President Francesco Cossiga immediately after leaving the chamber.
 Craxi has been prime minister, at the head of two separate but identical five-party coalitions, since August 1983.  Reuter &#3;
