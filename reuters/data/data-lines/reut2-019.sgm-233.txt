SMITHKLINE <SKB> SAYS BAUSCH <BOL> RECALL SET

Allergan Inc, a subsidiary of Smithkline Beckman Corp, said the U.S. District Court in New York has ordered Bausch and Lomb Inc to immediately recall from retail shelves all soft contact lens solutions sold under the "HYPO-CARE" name and cease any further distribution.
 The company said the court found that HYPO-CARE was too close to Allergan's trademark "HYDROCARE" to prevent public confusion.  Reuter &#3;
