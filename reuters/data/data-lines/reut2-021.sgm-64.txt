RENTA INMOBILIARIA SEEKS CANNON GROUP <CAN> ASSETS

Spanish property firm <Renta Inmobiliaria SA> is negotiating to buy the property assets of U.S. media company Cannon Group Inc <CAN>, Renta's finance director Jose Luis Sanchez said.
 Sanchez told Reuters that Renta's chairman Juan Antonio Robles was currently in the U.S. to negotiate the deal but declined to give other details.
 Interpart, a Luxembourg-based holding company chaired by Italian financier Giancarlo Paretti, payed around 12.2 billion pesetas in July to acquire a 63.5 pct stake in Renta Inmobiliaria.
 The Spanish daily newspaper El Pais said the Cannon property assets sought by Renta included the Elstree film studios in Britain and a chain of movie-theaters in Europe and the U.S.
