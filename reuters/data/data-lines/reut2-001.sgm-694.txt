FIRST UNION REAL ESTATE UNIT HIT WITH LABOR SUIT

The National Labor Relations Board said it issued an unfair Labor practice complaint against First Union Management, a unit of First Union Real Estate Investments <FUR>, for discouraging membership in a labor organization.
 The NLRB said the complaint asserts First Union Management hired a cleaning contractor, <Systems Management>, to clean the 300 Sixth Avenue Building in Pittsburgh on the condition that Systems not deal with the Service Employees International Union (SEIU), Local 29.
 Jack Yoedt, executive director of SEIU, the janitors union, said that damages could amount to more than 200,000 dlrs in back pay for janitors and that other damages may be forthcoming.  Reuter &#3;
