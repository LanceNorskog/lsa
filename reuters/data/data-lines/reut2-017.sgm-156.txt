ALGERIAN MINISTER RULES OUT DEBT RESCHEDULING

Algeria's Finance Minister Abdelaziz Khelaf said no rescheduling of his country's foreign debt is envisaged.
 Khelaf, who came to Geneva for a meeting organised by the Word Economic Forum, told Reuters Algerian debt amounted to about one third of the country's Gross National Product of 55 billion dlrs.
 France and Algeria yesterday finalised two agreements giving Algeria a total 580 mln dlrs in credits to finance trade and projects.  Reuter &#3;
