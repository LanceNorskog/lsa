INTERCONNECT OFFERS TO BUY GATES LEARJET <GLJ>

<Interconnect Capital Corp> said it sent a letter to the board of Gates Learjet Corp, offering to buy the company for 7.07 dlrs a share.
 Gates Corp, which owns 64.8 pct of Gates Learjet, agreed earlier this week to sell its shares to a partnership formed by privately-held <Cobey Corp> and a unit of Bear Stearns Cos Inc <BSC> for 6.50 dlrs a share or 51 mln dlrs. The proposal is subject to approval by Gates Learjet's board.
 A spokesman for privately-held Interconnect said it made the new proposal to Gates Learjet's board, but would not say if it had held talks with the parent company's board.
