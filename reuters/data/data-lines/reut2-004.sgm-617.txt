U.S. JUDGE DISMISSES SUIT CHALLENGING IRAN PROBE

A U.S. Judge dismissed a lawsuit by fired White House aide Oliver North seeking to halt a special prosecutor's investigation into the Iran arms scandal.
 In a 21-page ruling, Judge Barrington Parker threw out North's suit challenging the constitutionality of the law empowering special prosecutor Lawrence Walsh to investigate secret White House arms sales to Iran and the diversion of profits to contra rebels in Nicaragua.
 "The nation demands an expeditious and complete disclosure of our government's involvement in the Iran-contra affair," Parker said in his ruling.  REUTER &#3;
