LONDON EXCHANGE DECLINES COMMENT ON MERRILL CASE

The London Stock Exchange has no immediate comment on the U.S. Insider trading charge against a senior London executive of Merrill Lynch and Co <MER>, an Exchange spokesman said.
 "This is a civil action in New York and no-one here has any proper details yet," he added.
 The London Exchange, which keeps in touch through the U.K. Government's information channels to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, will await further developments, he said.
 Trade and Industry Department officials also declined immediate comment.
 Merrill Lynch in London said any further amplification on the SEC charge against its executive Nahum Vaskevitch would have to come from the firms's New York office.
 Market queries here centred on whether the 12 companies involved in mergers, referred to in the SEC complaint, included British companies such as Guinness Plc <GUIN.L> which have featured in recent official inquiries.
 Merrill Lynch is a member of the London Stock Exchange, in addition to its U.S. And other international investment activities.  Reuter &#3;
