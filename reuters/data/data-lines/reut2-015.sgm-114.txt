FORMER REPUBLIC WORKERS GET STOCK PAYOUT

The Brotherhood of Railway and Airline Clerks said more than 5,500 former Republic Airlines workers will receive an average of 10,000 dlrs each as part of a stock payout.
 It said some members will receive almost 19,000 dlrs in payments.
 The total 56 mln dlr payment comes from an employee stock ownership plan negotiated by several unions representing Republic employees before the carrier's takeover by <Northwest Airlines> in 1986, it said.  Reuter &#3;
