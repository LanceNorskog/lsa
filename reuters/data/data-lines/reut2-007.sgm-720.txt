U.S. TREASURY'S BAKER OPPOSES SECURITIES TAX

Treasury Secretary James Baker said he opposes a new tax on securities transactions.
 "No," he said when asked by a reporter whether he favored such a tax, which has been advocated by House Speaker James Wright (D-Tex).
 He added, "Not unless you want to tax a whole bunch of little security holders, which is not a good idea."  Reuter &#3;
