IRAQ SAYS IT HIT TWO SHIPS IN GULF, DOWNS IRAN F-4

Iraq said its warplanes attacked two large naval targets -- Baghdad's usual term for oil tankers or merchant ships -- in the Gulf today.
 A military spokesman said the planes scored accurate and effective hits in both attacks.
 There was no immediate confirmation of the raids from independent shipping sources in the region.
 The spokesman said during one of the attacks, Iraqi planes intercepted an Iranian F-4 Phantom and shot it down. All Iraqi warplanes returned safely to base, he added.  REUTER &#3;
