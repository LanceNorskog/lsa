DITTLER BROTHERS SEEK LOTTERY INVESTIGATIONS

Dittler Brothers called for investigations by the attorneys general of 24 states in connection with possible violation of state lottery laws by Bally Manufacturing Corp <BLY> and its subsidiary, Scientific Games.
 Dittler Brothers said it requested the states' law enforcement chiefs to investigate the companies following last week's determination by a court-appointed auditor that Scientific furnished erroneous information to those 24 state lottery officials.
 The states named are spread throughout the country.  Reuter &#3;
