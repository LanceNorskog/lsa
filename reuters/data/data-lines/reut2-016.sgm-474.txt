CANADA STOCKS/DOME PETROLEUM LTD <DMP>

Dome Petroleum Ltd shares moved higher in the U.S. and Canada after TransCanada PipeLines Ltd <TRP> made a 4.3 billion Canadian dlr bid for Dome and Dome said it is in talks with two other unidentified companies.
 Market speculation is that the other two potential bidders are not Canadian companies and DuPont's <DD> Conoco and Atlantic Richfield Co <ARC> are mentioned as possibilities, Wilf Gobert of Peters and Co Ltd said.
 Dome rose 1/4 to 1-1/8 on the American Stock Exchange. TransCanada PipeLines was down 1/4 at 15-3/4 on the New York Stock Exchange.
 Dome was the most active stock on the Toronto exchange at 1.50 dlrs per share, up 37 cts.
 Gobert characterized the market action in Dome as "awfully optimistic" but said investors are hoping for a competing offer to the shareholders.
 TransCanada PipeLines' offer is to Dome management, not to shareholders. However, it proposes issuing new equity in a subsidiary that would operate Dome assets. Current Dome shareholders would own 20 pct of the new subsidiary.  Reuter &#3;
