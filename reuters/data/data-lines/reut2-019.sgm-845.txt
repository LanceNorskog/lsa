INTELOGIC TRACE <IT> DEBT AFFIRMED BY S/P

Standard and Poor's Corp said it affirmed about 100 mln dlrs of B-minus subordinated debt of Intelogic Trace Inc.
 S and P cited the end of an attempted takeover of Burlington Industries Inc by an Asher Edelman-led group in which Intelogic was used as a financing vehicle. About 78 pct of Burlington's common shares were tendered to Morgan Stanley Group Inc, it added.
 S and P said Intelogic's problems expanding its computer maintenence activities have led to drops in revenues, but financial resources should remain supportive.  Reuter &#3;
