WITCO <WIT> UNIT OPENS FAST-OIL CHANGE CENTER

Kendall Refining Co, a unit of Witco Corp, and the <Knox Truck Stop> chain, said they have developed one of the nation's first fast-oil-change centers for trucks outside of Dallas.
 The service, called Fast Lube, offers a 60-minute oil change and inspection service for trucks and also involves a used-oil analysis program that relays engine information to the driver's fleet headquarters, the companies said.
 According to the companies, fast-oil-change centers are expected to grow from the current three pct of the oil lubrication market to 15 pct by 1990.

 In addition, Kendall said it recently launched a national Fast Lube program with <Avis Inc> that provides participating Avis Lube franchises with lubricants, equipment and marketing support.  Reuter &#3;
