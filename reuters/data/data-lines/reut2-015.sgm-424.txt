MEPC EXTENDS OFFER FOR OLDHAM

MEPC Plc <MEPC.L> said that its offer for <Oldham Estates Ltd> would remain open until further notice.
 On February 26 MEPC made an agreed bid for Oldham based on a formula reflecting its asset value at 30 September 1986. A year earlier Oldham's net asset value was put at 531.4 mln stg.
 As of 1 April the valuation used under the formula had still to be agreed so Oldham had yet to give a firm recommendation to its shareholders regarding the value of the the offer.  REUTER &#3;
