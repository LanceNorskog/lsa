TWO JAPANESE STEELMAKERS' CAPITAL SPENDING FALLS

Kawasaki Steel Corp <KAWS.T> said its parent company's capital spending in the year from April 1 will fall to 75 billion yen from 110 billion in the current year, and Sumitomo Metal Industries Ltd <SMIT.T> said its capital spending will drop to 70 billion yen from 85 billion.
 Both companies said they do not plan to start new large construction projects linked to production increases in the coming year, because of the yen's appreciation and slow world steel demand.  REUTER &#3;
