GEMINA HAS NO COMMENT ON AMBROSIANO REPORT

Holding company <Gemina Spa> said it had no comment on an Italian press report today that it has acquired a 12 pct stake in <Nuovo Banco Ambrosiano Spa>.
 Italian daily La Repubblica said that Gemina paid 205 billion lire for the shareholding from several Italian banks. A Gemina spokeswoman told Reuters, "We have nothing to say about the report."
 A spokeswoman for Milan-based Ambrosiano said, "We have no information at this time." In February, Ambrosiano chairman Giovanni Bazoli said foreign and domestic firms have expressed interest in buying stakes in the bank.
