ONEX PACKAGING CLOSES NEW BRUNSWICK PLANT

<Onex Packaging Inc> said it closed a small metal can manufacturing plant at St. Andrew's employing eight people that has been inactive since late 1985.
 Onex said the plant, producing six-ounce, two-piece metal cans for the fish industry, shut down when its major customer suddenly ceased canning operations.
 Onex has not been able to find sufficient demand to support this type of can manufacturing in the region, it said.  Reuter &#3;
