MALAYSIAN FIRM WINS U.S. JET SERVICE CONTRACT

<Airod Sdn Bhd> said it won a contract from the U.S. Air Force to repair and service landing gear and airframe parts of General Dynamics Corp <GD.N> F-16 and McDonnell Douglas Corp <MD.N> F-4 jet fighters.
 The one-year contract, worth 1.3 mln ringgit, was signed recently and work is expected to begin soon, an Airod spokesman told Reuters.
 Airod is a joint venture between Lockheed Corp <LK.N> unit <Lockheed Aircraft Service International> and <Aerospace Industries Malaysia>
 Airod, which was set up in 1985, has a paid-up capital of 5.6 mln ringgit, the spokesman said.
 He said that under the contract, jet parts from U.S. Air Force bases in the Philippines, Japan and South Korea would be sent to Airod for servicing and repair. If the Air Force was satisfied with its performance, the contract could be extended, he said. Airod now services some Royal Malaysian Air Force and Indonesian Air Force aircraft, he said.
 Aerospace Industries is equally owned by the Malaysian government, Malaysian Airline System <MAIM.SI> and <United Motor Works Bhd>.  REUTER &#3;
