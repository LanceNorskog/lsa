CENTRAL MAINE <CTP> SEEKS COGENERATOR SPONSORS

Central Maine Power Co said it issued a request for proposals for about 150 project sponsors of cogeneration and small power production projects.
 The utility said it is soliciting proposals to fill about 100 megawatts of commitments to the Maine Public Utilities Commission. The avoided costs which will be paid for power produced by these projects will be based on costs negotiated between Central Maine and Hydro-Quebec for planned power purchases beginning in 1992.
