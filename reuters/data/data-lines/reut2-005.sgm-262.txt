AQUINO DISBANDS VIGILANTE GROUPS

President Aquino has ordered the dissolution of all armed civilian vigilante groups around the Philippines, officials said.
 The order follows protests about the activities of vigilantes by human-rights activists, but goes against calls by the military for more such groups.
 The vigilantes have been credited with a major role in recent successes in several districts against communist rebels.   Reuter &#3;
