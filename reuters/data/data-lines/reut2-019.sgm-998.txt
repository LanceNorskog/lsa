CANON STOPS PRODUCTION OF LOW-END WORD PROCESSORS

Canon Inc <CANN.T> said it will stop making Japanese language word processors with retail prices below 50,000 yen and consign production instead to <Kyushu Matsushita Electronic Co Ltd>, a 51.75-pct owned unit of Matsushita Electric Industrial Co Ltd <MC.T>.
 A Canon spokesman said the move reflects intense price competition as Canon, Casio Computer Co Ltd <CACT.T> and others compete in the growing market for low-end processors.
 Canon will focus production on more expensive and sophisticated models which have more generous profit margins, he said.  REUTER &#3;
