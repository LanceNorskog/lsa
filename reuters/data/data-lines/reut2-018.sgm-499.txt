CANADIAN MINES AGREE TO CUT COAL PRICE

Members of the Bull Moose coking coal mine in British Columbia, Canada, agreed to cut the base price they charge Japanese steelmakers to 91.77 Canadian dlrs a tonne FOB for the year from April 1, down 14 dlrs from 1986/87, an official at a company involved in the deal said.
 The Nippon Kokan KK <NKKT.T> official said the cut was agreed after five months of talks between <Teck Corp>, <Rornex Mining Corp Ltd> and <Nissho Iwai Coal Development (Canada) Ltd>.
 He said the Japanese side would continue to ask the miners to improve the quality of Bull Moose coal's ash specification.
 Japanese steel mills and several Canadian exporters including the sellers of Bull Moose coal have had several rounds of negotiations on coking coal base prices this year, industry sources said.
 The Japanese steel firms started a new round of base price talks with <Quintette Coals Ltd> yesterday, while discussions with <Gregg River Co Ltd> will be held later this month, they said.
 Nissho Iwai Coal is a unit of <Nissho Iwai Corp> of Japan.  REUTER &#3;
