P.S. INDIANA <PIN> BONDS UPGRADED BY S/P

Standard and Poor's Corp said it raised to BBB-plus from BBB Public Service Co of Indiana's first mortgage bonds.
 The utility's BBB-minus preferred stock was affirmed. The company has one billion dlrs of debt outstanding.
 S and P cited continuing improvement in earnings protection measures because of a 1986 emergency rate increase.
 While various writeoffs related to the abandoned Marble Hill nuclear facility have weakened common equity, the retention of all common earnings until at least 1989 will help restore capital structure balance fairly quickly, S/P said.  Reuter &#3;
