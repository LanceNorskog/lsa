SHULTZ ARRIVES IN MOSCOW FOR ARMS TALKS

U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz arrived in Moscow for talks with Soviet leaders likely to focus on nuclear arms reductions.
 Shultz flew in from Helsinki and drove straight from the airport to a meeting with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze.
 The three days of talks are overshadowed by an espionage row between the two powers. Shultz has said he wants to discuss it but Soviet officials have indicated they expect him to concentrate on disarmament issues.  Reuter &#3;
