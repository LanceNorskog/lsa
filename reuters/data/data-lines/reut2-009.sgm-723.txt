AIDC ISSUES FIRST AUSTRALIAN DLR MEDIUM TERM NOTES

The Australian Industry Development Corp (AIDC) said it issued 20 mln Australian dlrs of five-year notes in London.
 The notes, issued in denominations of 50,000 dlrs, were part of a 10-year, one billion U.S. Dlr multicurrency facility established last December, it said in a statement.
