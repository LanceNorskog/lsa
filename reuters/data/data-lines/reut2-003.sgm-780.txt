CHRYSLER <C> TO USE TELECREDIT <TCRD> PRODUCT

Chrysler Corp said it will use a product designed by Telecredit Inc's Light Signatures Inc unit to prevent counterfeit automotive parts.
 Light Signatures will provide coded warranty labels for Chrysler's replacement parts. The system will first be used for glass and then expanded to other products.
 Parts replaced by independent repair shops, and containing the coded warranty label, will be tested by Chrysler dealers to ensure authenticity.
 The company also said the system will tracks each piece of warranty glass distributed by Chrysler.   Reuter &#3;
