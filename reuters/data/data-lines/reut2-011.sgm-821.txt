MITSUBISHI HEAVY, C. ITOH TO SELL TRIGUNA STAKES

Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd <MITH.T> (MHI) and C. Itoh and Co Ltd <CITT.T> have decided to sell their combined 65 pct stake in Indonesia's <Pt Triguna Utama Machinery Industries> to <Caterpillar Tractor Co>,  spokesmen for the two Japanese companies said.
Triguna, set up in 1982, is owned 40 pct by MHI and 25 pct by C. Itoh and 35 pct by an Indonesian company. It makes about 10 forklift trucks and a similar number of excavators each month in technological cooperation with MHI.
 The spokesmen said the sale results from an expected restructuring later this year of the 50/50 Caterpillar/MHI joint venture Japanese company <Caterpillar Mitsubishi Ltd>, formed in 1963.
 They said the venture will be renamed <Shin Caterpillar Mitsubishi Ltd> and capitalised at 23 billion yen. It will still be owned equally by MHI and Caterpillar and will be set up with the aim of centralising MHI's excavator business.  REUTER &#3;
