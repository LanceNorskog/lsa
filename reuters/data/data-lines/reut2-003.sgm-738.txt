SYNERGEN <SYGN> TO MAKE DRUG FOR CIBA-GEIGY

Synergen Inc said it agreed to provide its human elastase inhibitor, designed to treat emphysema, to Ciba-Geigy AG <CIGZ> for human clinical trials.
 Ciba-Geigy is currently testing the substance in animals, but the company said the new supplies of the drug will be suitable for human tests.
 The company said Ciba-Geigy initially licensed the product in 1985. The new agreement calls for Synergen to set up a commercial manufacturing process to produce the drug and deliver quantities to Ciba-Geigy in the second half 1987.  Reuter &#3;
