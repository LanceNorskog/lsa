BOLIDEN SAYS IT NOW LEADER IN MINING GEAR

Swedish mining and metals group Boliden AB <BLDS.ST> said the takeover of the U.S. Allis-Chalmers Corp's <AH.O> mining machinery division made it the world's leading maker of such equipment.
 President Kjell Nilsson, announcing the 600 mln crown deal, told a news conference Boliden would now become a truly international concern with operations in Brazil, Chile and other big minerals-producing nations.
 He said the Allis-Chalmers' division, accounting for some 50 pct of the U.S. Group's sales, would fit in well into Boliden.  REUTER &#3;
