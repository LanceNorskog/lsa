FRANCE AGREES AIRBUS A340 COMMERCIALLY SOUND

The French government has no reason to doubt the European Airbus consortium's assessment that its A340 long-range jet project has a sound commercial basis, French Trade Minister Michel Noir said .
 Airbus announced last Friday that it had 104 firm orders and options from nine airlines for its A340 long-range and A330 medium-range jet projects.
 "If Airbus finds an initial cushion of around one hundred aircraft satisfactory, we have no reason to contradict them," Noir told journalists.  Reuter &#3;
