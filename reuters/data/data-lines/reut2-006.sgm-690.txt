UNISYS <UIS> MERGES UNIX COMPUTER SYSTEMS

Unisys Corp said that UNIX OS-based computer systems previously offered by Sperry and Burroughs have been merged into a single family of products.
 It said completeness of product line, brand recognition and commitment to customers and original equipment manufacturer vendors prompted the move.
 Unisys UNIX OS products consist of compatible software packages, terminals and printers for use in such applications as small business accounting systems to networking requirements of distributed processing.  Reuter &#3;
