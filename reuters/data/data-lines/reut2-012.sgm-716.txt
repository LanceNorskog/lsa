BELL PETROLEUM <BPSIQ> DISCUSSES REORGANIZATION

Bell Petroleum Services Inc said it will continue to talk with Regal International Inc <RGL> about being acquired, but maintained it will pursue alternatives as part of its reorganization plan.
 Any plan of reorganization Bell arrives at would be subject to approval by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Midland, Texas, Bell said.
 The agreement also terminates all current litigation between Regal and Bell involving previous reorganization plans, in which Regal attempted to acquire Bell, the company said.  Reuter &#3;
