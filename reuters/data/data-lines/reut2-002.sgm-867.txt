FDA APPROVES CEPHRADINE BY ZENITH <ZEN>

Zenith Laboratories Inc said the Food and Drug Administration approved Cephradine, an antibiotic, for marketing.
 The maker of generic drugs, less costly versions of brand name drugs that have lost their patents, said Cephradine has been available as Velosef from Squibb Corp <SQB> and Anspor from a SmithKline Beckman Corp <SKB> unit.
 Earlier this week the company said it received FDA marketing approval for Cefadroxil, another antibiotic, which it said it will market once questions "relating to patent applicability are resolved."  Reuter &#3;
