OKI ELECTRIC STUDIES IMPORT OF U.S. CAR PHONES

<Oki Electric Industry Co Ltd> may import car telephones made by its 100 pct U.S. Subsidiary, <Oki America Inc>, for sale in Japan, an Oki spokesman said.
 The firm would like to import the car phones, which are made according to a system developed jointly by Motorola Inc <MOT> of the U.S. And Oki Electric, the spokesman said.
 A final decision will hinge on obtaining approval from Japan's Post and Telecommunications Ministry and whether or not it is feasible to convert the models to meet Japanese specifications, he said.  REUTER &#3;
