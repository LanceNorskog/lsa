BEKER <BKI> REORGANIZATION PLAN DELAYED

Beker Industries Corp said it was unable to confirm its plan for reorganization at a March 5 hearing before the U.S. Bankruptcy Court because necessary agreements had not been reached with its institutional lenders.
 The company said it could set no specific date for completing its reorganization.
 At the March 5 hearing, the company said it filed a motion for approval of an agreement that has been reached in principal with a unit of Freeport-McMoRan Inc <FTX> for the sale of Beker's facilities in Louisiana and Florida.  Reuter &#3;
