BZW MAKES MARKETS IN JAPAN DOLLAR CONVERTIBLES

Barclays De Zoete Wedd Ltd said it today began market-making in Japanese convertible eurobonds denominated in dollars.
 This venture will be followed within a few months by the establishment of a trading operation for Japanese U.S. Dollar-denominated equity warrant issues.
 Director in charge of the Japanese convertible operation is Kelvin Saunders, who said the desk was currently staffed by seven traders and salespeople. This number would be doubled with the addition of the equity warrant operation, "an even more important element in the current market environment," he said.  REUTER &#3;
