BEN EQUITY HOLDINGS <BH> SUSPENDED ON NYSE

The New York Stock Exchange said trading in the units of BenEquity Holdings, a California Limited Partnership, was suspended before the opening and an application will be made to the Securities and Exchange Commission to delist the issue.
 The Exchange said it normally considers suspending and removing from its list the securities of a company when fewer than 600,000 units are held by the public.
 As a result of a tender offer by <Renouf Corp International>, which expired March 24, 1987, fewer than 600,000 units of BenEquity remained publicly held.
