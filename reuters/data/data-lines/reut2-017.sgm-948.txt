INTEL, MATRA-HARRIS DISSOLVE CIMATEL PARTNERSHIP

Intel Corp <INTC> of Santa Clara, Calif. And Matra-Harris-Semiconducteurs (MHS) said their Cimatel joint venture design facility was dissolved as from June 1.
 Intel makes logic and memory components. MHS is a joint venture of the Matra group <MATR.PA> and Harris Corp <HRS>.
 Cimatel was formed in 1982 to design standard VLSI devices for the telecommunications and computer graphics markets.
 MHS said in a statement that changing market conditions had led Intel to reassess its marketing policy. It had concluded that without common marketing goals a common design centre was impractical.  REUTER &#3;
