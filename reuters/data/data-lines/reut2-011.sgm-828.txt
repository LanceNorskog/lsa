BOLIDEN TAKES OVER ALLIS-CHALMERS DIVISION

Swedish mining and metals group Boliden AB <BLDS ST> said it would buy the mining equipment operations of the U.S. Allis-Chalmers Corp <AH.O>, amounting to more than 50 pct of group sales, for 600 mln crowns.
 Boliden president Kjell Nilsson told a news conference the acquisition of the Allis-Chalmers unit, which he described as the world's leading producer of equipment for the mineral processing industry, would yield positive synergy effects for Boliden mining, metals and engineering operations.
 Nilsson said the takeover also will provide opportunities to cooperate with the mining and materials handling operations of Boliden's parent company, <Trelleborg AB>.
 He said Allis-Chalmers was selling out because it needed new cash after suffering big losses in its farm equipment operation.
 The deal is subject to approval by Allis-Chalmers' annual meeting, company officials said.  REUTER &#3;
