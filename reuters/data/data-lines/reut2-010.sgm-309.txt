MITSUBISHI BUYS INTO DANISH DAIRY PRODUCT FIRM

Mitsubishi Corp <MITT.TOK> said it has taken a 25 pct stake worth five mln krone in <Danish Dairy Farms Ltd> and will jointly market its produce from April.
 The company was set up last year by three major Danish livestock cooperative federations to expand markets for their dairy products, a Mitsubishi official said.
 This is the first time a Japanese trading house has traded non-Japanese dairy products in the world market, he said.
 He said Mitsubishi expects the Danish company's annual sales to be 10 billion yen in its first year, from April 1.  REUTER &#3;
