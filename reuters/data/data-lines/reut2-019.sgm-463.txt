DART GROUP DECLINES COMMENT ON DAYTON HUDSON<DH>

Dart Group Corp <DARTA.O> said it has no comment on reports the company has been accumulating shares of Dayton Hudson Corp.
 Dayton Hudson said in a letter to shareholders it told an "aggressive buyer" of its stock that it does not want to be acquired.
 Wall Street sources have identified the buyer as Dart, which earlier this year was thwarted in a takeover attempt for the now privately held Supermarkets General Corp.  Reuter &#3;
