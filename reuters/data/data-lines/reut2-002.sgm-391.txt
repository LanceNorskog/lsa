CALNY <CLNY> DIRECTOR RESIGNS OVER LAWSUIT

Calny Inc director and former president and chief executive officer said he is resigning from Calny's board because of the company's recently announced lawsuit against Pepsico Inc <PEP> and its La Petite Boulangerie.
 In a statement, Larvive said the suit is a "lose-lose" situation for Calny, which is the only franchisee for La Petite Boulangerie and is the largest francisee of PepsiCo's Taco Bell Corp.  Reuter &#3;
