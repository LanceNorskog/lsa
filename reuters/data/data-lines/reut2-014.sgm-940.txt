UNILEVER SEEKS BUYER FOR STAUFFER CHEMICAL

Unilever Plc and NV <UN.AS> has issued a prospectus through investment bankers Goldman Sachs and Co seeking a buyer for <Stauffer Chemical Co> of the U.S., Which it acquired with the recent takeover of <Chesebrough-Pond's Inc>, a Unilever spokesman said.
 He noted Unilever has been indicating plans to dispose of Stauffer, plus some smaller assets of Chesebrough, since the bid was made in December.
 The Stauffer sale prospectus has been sent in recent weeks to a number of companies expressing interest.
 The Unilever spokesman declined to say how much the group expected to receive for Stauffer.
 Chesebrough's footwear and tennis racket businesses are also likely to be disposed of, he added.
 Immediately available financial information on Stauffer, which is wholly-owned, was limited, he added. Nine month sales to September 1986 were about 1.2 billion dlrs.
 Unilever aquired Chesebrough for 3.2 billion dlrs in order to benefit from its well-known toiletry brands and food products.  Reuter &#3;
