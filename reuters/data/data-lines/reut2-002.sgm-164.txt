OGDEN <OG> DEVICE APPROVED BY U.S. FOR TESTING

Ogden Corp said a unit won approval from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to test a bed combuster, a device that burns some hazardous wastes under highly controlled conditions.
 The company said the approval will allow its Ogden Environmental Services unit to operate a pilot scale model of the device, test the results, and fine tune the instrument to burn a number of wastes. Testing begins at the end of March.
 The wastes include contaminated soils, chlorinated solvents such as carbon tetrachloride, non-chlorinated solvents like toluene, and distillation residues, it said.  Reuter &#3;
