ITALIAN MINISTER APPROVES TELECOMMUNICATIONS FIRM

Italy's Ministry of State Participation said it formally approved the telecommunications joint venture between STET, a subsidiary of the state holding company <Istituto per la Ricostruzione Industriale> (IRI) and Fiat Spa <FIAT.MI>.
 A ministry spokesman said Minister Clelio Darida passed the joint venture <Telit - Telecommunicazioni Italiane Spa> this morning. Darida's approval was needed for the venture.
 STET and Fiat each hold 48 pct of Telit's capital, with the remaining stake held by state merchant bank Mediobanca Spa <MDBI.MI>.
 The spokesman said Darida's approval includes a provision that if the government eventually reduces its majority stake in Mediobanca, the bank's four pct Telit shareholding will be transferred to another public financial institution.
 As reported, Telit will group the operations of Fiat's subsidiary Telettra Spa and STET's Italtel - Societa Italiana Telecommunicazioni Spa.  REUTER &#3;
