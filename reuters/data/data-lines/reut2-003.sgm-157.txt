ENTERRA <EN> CREDIT LINE CUT

Enterra Corp said its bank group has reduced its revolving credit agreement to 40 mln dlrs from 60 mln dlrs.
 Also, the company said it and its units granted the group a security interest in their assets.
 Enterra said the change resulted from Enterra's previously announced agreement to sell its Hale Fire Pump Co and Macomson Machine Co for about 27 mln dlrs as part of its restructuring.  Reuter &#3;
