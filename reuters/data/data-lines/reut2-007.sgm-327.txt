JOHNSON URGES SECURITIES POWERS FOR BANKS

Federal Reserve Board Vice Chairman Manuel Johnson said the Federal Reserve favored adding securities powers to banking legislation.
 "We support any willingness to add those powers to the legislation," Johnson told the Women in Housing and Finance.
 "We would prefer to see those powers in the legislation."
 He was referring to a banking bill introduced by Sen William Proxmire (D-Wisc) which would impose a moratorium on extending new securities powers to banks.  Reuter &#3;
