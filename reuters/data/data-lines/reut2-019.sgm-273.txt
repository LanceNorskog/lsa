WORLD BANK TO LOAN JAMAICA 104 MLN DLRS

The World Bank said it approved four loans to Jamaica totalling 104 mln dlrs to assist that country with an economic structural adjustment program, a sugar industry rehabilitation scheme and a population and health project.
 The bank said two loans will support Jamaica's structural adjustment program -- a 40 mln dlr loan for trade and financial sector adjustment and a 20 mln dlr loan for the public enterprise sector.
 The 40 mln dlr loan is designed to raise the performance of exports and industry and strengthen the financial sector.  Reuter &#3;
