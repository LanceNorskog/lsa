BRAZIL ANNOUNCES NEW PLANNING MINISTER

Brazil's new planning minister is Anibal Teixeira de Souza, the former head of a national welfare program, the government said.
 Teixeira replaces economist Joao Sayad, who last week became the latest victim of the turmoil in Brasilia over government economic policy.
 Sayad disagreed with Finance Minister Dilson Funaro, the most important minister for economic affairs, on a range of policy issues and submitted his resignation.  Reuter &#3;
