GENETIC LABORATORIES <GENL.O> SETS UP UNIT

Genetic Laboratories Inc said it set up a wholly owned subsidiary that will encorporate its reconstructive plastic surgery products.
 Genetic Laboratories said one of the reasons for the move was to "facilitate the sale or merger" of the business "with other companies specializing in plastic surgery."  Reuter &#3;
