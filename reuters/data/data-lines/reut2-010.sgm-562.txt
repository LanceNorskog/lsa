FRENCH MINISTERIAL MEETING HELD ON CGCT SALE

Finance Minister Edouard Balladur, Industry Minister Alain Madelin and Telecommunications Minister Gerard Longuet met for more than an hour today to discuss the imminent sale of the French telephone switching group <Cie Generale de Constructions Telephoniques>, a spokesman for Longuet said.
 No decision was announced as a result of the meeting, and the French government has given itself until the end of next month to choose between the candidates.
 The sale of CGCT, which controls 16 pct of France's telephone market, has been priced at 500 mln francs, and three international consortia are battling for the right to buy it.
 West Germany's Siemens AG <SIEG.F> has teamed up with the French group Jeumont-Schneider, in opposition to a bid from the U.S. Group ATT <T.N> and the Dutch Philips Telecommunications BV <PGLO.AS> in association with the French telecommunications firm SAT <Societe Anonyme de Telecommunications>.
 A third bid has been lodged by Sweden's AB LM Ericsson <ERIC.ST>, allied with French defence electronics group Matra <MATR.PA> and Bouygues SA <BOUY.PA>.  Reuter &#3;
