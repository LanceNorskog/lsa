PERIPHERAL SYSTEMS <PSIX> AGRESS TO BUY COMPANY

Peripheral Systems Inc said it agreed in principle to acquire the outstanding shares of <Nucell Inc>.
 The agreement calls for an exchange of one share of Peripheral for each share of Nucell, subject to approval by both companies' boards, it said.
 Peripheral said its increased involvement in the development of Nucell's nuclear battery technology made the merger practical.  Reuter &#3;
