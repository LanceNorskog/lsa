HYBRITECH <HYBR> ASKS FOR REVIEW OF ITS PATENT

Hybritech Inc said the U.S. Supreme Court denied a petition by Monoclonal Antibodies Inc asking the court to review the validity of a Hybritech patent.
 The patent covers a method of using monoclonal antibodies in certain immunoassay tests to detect and monitor conditions such as pregnancy, cancer and infectious disease.
 Hybritech sued Monoclonal in March 1984 for infringement of its patent.  Reuter &#3;
