/**
 * Computes on-line estimates of mean, variance and all five quartiles (notably including the
 * median).  Since this is done in a completely incremental fashion (that is what is meant by
 * on-line) estimates are available at any time and the amount of memory used is constant.  Somewhat
 * surprisingly, the quantile estimates are about as good as you would get if you actually kept all
 * of the samples.
 * <p/>
 * The method used for mean and variance is Welford's method.  See
 * <p/>
 * http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithms_for_calculating_variance#On-line_algorithm
 * <p/>
 * The method used for computing the quartiles is a simplified form of the stochastic approximation
 * method described in the article "Incremental Quantile Estimation for Massive Tracking" by Chen,
 * Lambert and Pinheiro
 * <p/>
